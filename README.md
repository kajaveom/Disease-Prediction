Development and exploration of several Data analytics techniques in various real-time applications (e.g Industry, Healthcare Neuro-Science) in various domains have led to exploitation of it to extract paramount features from datasets. Following the introduction of new computer technology, the health sector had a significant transformation that compelled it to produce more medical data, which gave rise to a number of new disciplines of study. Numerous initiatives are made to deal with the explosion of medical data on the one hand, and to learn anything from it on the other. This inspired academic to employ all technological advancements, including data analytics, predictive analytics, machine learning, and learning algorithms, to extract practical information and aid in decision-making. The healthcare data can be used to develop a health prediction system that can improve a person's health. Based on the dataset provided, making accurate predictions in early disease prediction benefits the human community.
